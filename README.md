# String Substitution

- Developed a software for inline string substituion without creating a temporary file or doing it in multiple pass.
- It is done with the minimum memory usage
- a character or a string can be replaced by another character or set of character.
ex.
  in the word mississippi
  
   * case 1 : s replaced by z
   * case 2 : s replaced by ab
   * case 3 : mis replaced by a
   * case 4 : mis replaced by xyz
   * case 5 : mis replaced by xyzw
  
  etc.

** Documentation is also provided.
