# String Substitution

- Developed a software for inline string substituion without creating a temporary file or doing it in multiple pass.
- It is done with the minimum memory usage
- a character or a string can be replaced by another character or set of character.
ex.
  in the word mississippi
  
   ** case 1 : s replaced by z
   ** case 2 : s replaced by ab
  case 3 : mis replaced by a
  case 4 : mis replaced by xyz
  case 5 : mis replaced by xyzw
  
  etc.
